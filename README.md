Pandas Challenge Four

Envision yourself as the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.



For this week's challenge I recieved feedback and guideness from our TA's and attended a tutoring session. As noted in the starter code I included my written analysis above my written code.
